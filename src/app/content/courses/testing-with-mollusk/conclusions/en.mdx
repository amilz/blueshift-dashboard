# Conclusions

Congratulations! You've completed the Testing with Mollusk course. You now have a comprehensive understanding of how to use Mollusk, a powerful lightweight testing framework for Solana programs that provides fast execution, precise control, and detailed performance insights.

<ArticleSection name="What you've learned" id="what-you-learned" level="h2" />

Throughout this course, you've gained essential knowledge about:
- How Mollusk provides a streamlined testing environment using low-level Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) components
- The advantages of Mollusk's lightweight approach over full validator simulation
- Setting up Mollusk with the core `mollusk-svm` crate and program-specific helpers
- Using Mollusk's four main execution APIs for single and chained instruction testing
- Implementing comprehensive validation checks for success conditions, compute units, and account states
- Creating pre-initialized token accounts (Mints, Token Accounts, Associated Token Accounts)
- Benchmarking compute unit consumption with `MolluskComputeUnitBencher`
- Developing and testing custom syscalls for specialized functionality
- Customizing execution environment through compute budgets, feature sets, and sysvars

<ArticleSection name="Next Steps" id="next-steps" level="h2" />

You're now equipped with the knowledge to build robust, well-tested Solana programs using Mollusk! Here are some recommended next steps:
1. Practice with Real Programs: Apply your Mollusk knowledge to test your own Solana programs, starting with simple instructions and gradually building up to complex workflows
2. Explore Challenges: Visit the [Challenges section](/en/challenges) for hands-on exercises that will help you apply your Mollusk testing skills
3. Join the Community: Connect with other developers using Mollusk to share testing strategies and best practices on our discord
4. Stay Updated: Follow the [Mollusk repository](https://github.com/anza-xyz/mollusk) for the latest features and improvements
